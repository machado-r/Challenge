# Fotontech Challenge


## How to run this project?
1. cd server and run `npm i`;
2. cd frontend and run `npm i`;
3. Go to `/frontend/src/App.js` and change the URI to your local GraphQL server
4. cd server and run `nodemon`
5. cd frontend and run `react-native run-ios`, or react-native `run-android`

There is no need to setup a local MongoDB, the database is handled with mlab cloud.
